# Coda-detector
A program written in Matlab for detecting the  sperm whales communication signals ("codas")  and seperating between vocalizers in short time buffers

To run the program, please open Main_program.m and click the 'run' bottom Several dialouge boxes will be opened where you can enter the desired recording as well as the parameter settings. The program outputs a figure of the measured signal with the detected codas marked in different colors. The detections are automatically saved in a csv file. The arrival times of the clicks of each coda are logged as well. 

The Data folder contains one recording example from each of the datasets presented in the paper: "Automatic Detection and Annotation of Sperm Whale Codas: a test case for the Dominica Island"
